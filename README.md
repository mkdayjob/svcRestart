# svcRestart
powershell cmdlet to restart a service (example is the audio service) 
This is just a quick ps1 that runs with elevation and restarts a service. it has a pre and post check on it because I felt fancy. 
It assumes your powershell execution policy is set correctly and that powershell itself can run with elevation. 
Obviously, you can customize it for a different servicce if you know the service name.
